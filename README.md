# alpha-mail
We propose an email classification system pipeline and deployment in the form of a Chrome extension tailored to Harvard students. Through the Gmail RESTful API, we preprocess an email inbox by extracting the author, subject, and importance score of each email. We then use supervised learning to estimate an importance label for each email. Training occurs on a classification head. The classification head is fed embeddings generated by LLMs that process the author and the subject line. We use multiple models and find that GPT Ada- embedding-002 is the best. The MSE loss on the test data, which comprises 20% of the inbox data, is 0.0291. Model predictions are skewed toward generating low importance scores (shown in Table 3), since most of the training data is made up of low importance scores. Although predictions are far for the highest labels (average of 0.36 instead of 1), relativity is still maintained: important emails are predicted to be more important than unimportant emails— even if the difference in prediction isn’t as high as anticipated. Results suggest that our pipeline is capable of accurately classifying emails according to their importance.
